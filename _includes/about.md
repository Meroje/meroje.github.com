Hi, I'm Tom
===========

My name is Tom Broerse. I'm a full stack web application developer living in
Melbourne, Australia. 

I've been building for the web since the late nineties when I first booted 
MS FrontPage to create a website, complete with blink and marquee tags, to
publish music I made with a few high school friends.

Nowadays, I work as a web development team leader at 
[Infoxchange Australia](http://www.infoxchange.net.au "Infoxchange Australia website"), 
coding for social justice.

In my free time I enjoy surfing, soccer and occasionally writing
code and playing around with new web technologies.
